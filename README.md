This project analyzes the sales data of a coffee shop to derive insights about sales trends, product performance, and customer preferences. The goal is to use data analytics to help the shop optimize its operations, identify its best-selling products, and forecast future sales.
The analysis consists of several key steps:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends in sales volume, revenue, and product popularity.
Sales Trends Analysis: Identifying peak times, seasonal patterns, and daily/hourly sales breakdowns.
Product Performance: Analyzing best-selling products and product categories.
Key findings from the analysis include:
Identification of the top-selling products and categories.
Insights into the busiest times of day and peak sales periods.
Trends in customer preferences and repeat purchases.
Sales forecasts for the upcoming quarter.
